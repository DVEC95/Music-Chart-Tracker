# The UK Top 20 Music Chart Tracker

This simple, dynamic web app fetches the top 20 songs in the UK from the [iTunes API](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json) and displays them as a list complete with cover art, an audio preview and my gaudy design.

  2. Navigate into the root folder and run the following command to install dependencies:
  ```npm install```
  3. To start the app, run the following command:

  4. Enjoy the music or not...
